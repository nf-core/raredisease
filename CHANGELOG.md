## v1.1.1 - Abu (Patch) [2023-07-26]

### `Fixed`

- Avoids errors thrown by bcftools concat due to sample names in input vcf files not being in same order [#388](https://github.com/nf-core/raredisease/pull/388)

## v1.1.0 - Abu [2023-07-21]

### `Added`

- Add GATK's cnv calling pipeline [#362](https://github.com/nf-core/raredisease/pull/362)
- GATK's ShiftFasta to generate all the files required for mitochondrial analysis [#354](https://github.com/nf-core/raredisease/pull/354)
- Feature to calculate CADD scores for indels [#325](https://github.com/nf-core/raredisease/pull/325)
- HmtNote to annotate mitochondria [#355](https://github.com/nf-core/raredisease/pull/355)
- MT del script to detect mitochondrial deletions [#349](https://github.com/nf-core/raredisease/pull/349)
- eKLIPse to identify large mitochondrial deletions [#365](https://github.com/nf-core/raredisease/pull/365)
- UPD+Chromograph to identify and visualize UPD sites and regions in the chromosomes [#364](https://github.com/nf-core/raredisease/pull/364) and [#366](https://github.com/nf-core/raredisease/pull/366)
- Added check for presence of case id for each sample in samplesheet [#357](https://github.com/nf-core/raredisease/pull/357)

### Fixed

- Avoiding publishing uncompressed VCF-file from `HMTNOTE_ANNOTATE`. (The corresponding compressed VCF-file still gets published.) [#368](https://github.com/nf-core/raredisease/pull/368)

## v1.0.0 - Aladdin [2023-06-01]

Initial release of nf-core/raredisease, created with the [nf-core](https://nf-co.re/) template.

### `Added`

- Qualimap & Picard tools quality control metrics
- Call repeat expansions with ExpansionHunter and Stranger
- SNV calling with DeepVariant/Sentieon
- SV calling with Manta and TIDDIT
- SNV annotation with bcftools roh, vcfanno, and vep
- SV annotation with SVDB query and vep
- Separate workflow for analysing and annotating mitochondrial variants
- Call copy number variants in the SMN gene using SMNCopyNumberCaller
