### Alignment

#### Mapping

##### Bwa-mem2

[Bwa-mem2](https://github.com/bwa-mem2/bwa-mem2) used to map the reads to a reference genome. The aligned reads are coordinate sorted with samtools sort. These files are treated as intermediates and are not placed in the output folder by default.

##### Sentieon bwa mem

[Sentieon's bwa mem](https://support.sentieon.com/manual/DNAseq_usage/dnaseq/#map-reads-to-reference) is the software accelerated version of the bwa-mem algorithm. It is used to efficiently perform the alignment using BWA. Aligned reads are then coordinate sorted using Sentieon's [sort](https://support.sentieon.com/manual/usages/general/#util-syntax) utility. These files are treated as intermediates and are not placed in the output folder by default. It is not the default aligner, but it can be chosen over bwamem2 by setting `--aligner` option to sentieon.

#### Duplicate marking

##### Picard's MarkDuplicates

[Picard MarkDuplicates](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html#MarkDuplicates) is used for marking PCR duplicates that can occur during library amplification. This is essential as the presence of such duplicates results in false inflated coverages, which in turn can lead to overly-confident genotyping calls during variant calling. Only reads aligned by Bwa-mem2 are processed by this tool.

### Quality control and reporting

#### Quality control

##### FastQC

[FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) gives general quality metrics about your sequenced reads. It provides information about the quality score distribution across your reads, per base sequence content (%A/T/G/C), adapter contamination and overrepresented sequences. For further reading and documentation see the [FastQC help pages](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/).

##### Mosdepth

[Mosdepth](https://github.com/brentp/mosdepth) is used to report quality control metrics such as coverage, and GC content from alignment files. The global distribution file, generated by this program is passed to MultiQC for generating the following plots,

- Cumulative coverage distribution
- Coverage distribution
- Average coverage per contig

</details>

##### Picard tools

[Picard's CollectMutipleMetrics, CollectHsMetrics, and CollectWgsMetrics](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) We use Picardtools' CollectWgsMetrics and CollectHsMetrics utilities to calculate metrics about coverage and performance of WGS & WES experiments. In addition to those metrics, we use CollectMultipleMetrics to gather information about alignment summary, insert size, GC content etc., The metrics generated by these three utilites are passed along to MultiQC to generate several plots as well.

#### Reporting

##### MultiQC

[MultiQC](http://multiqc.info) is a visualization tool that generates a single HTML report summarising all samples in your project. Most of the pipeline QC results are visualised in the report and further statistics are available in the report data directory.

Results generated by MultiQC collate pipeline QC from supported tools e.g. FastQC. The pipeline has special steps which also allow the software versions to be reported in the MultiQC output for future traceability. For more information about how to use MultiQC reports, see <http://multiqc.info>.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `multiqc/`
  - `multiqc_report.html`: a standalone HTML file that can be viewed in your web browser.
  - `multiqc_data/`: directory containing parsed statistics from the different tools used in the pipeline.
  - `multiqc_plots/`: directory containing static images from the report in various formats.

</details>

### Variant calling - SNV

#### DeepVariant

[DeepVariant](https://github.com/google/deepvariant) is a deep learning-based variant caller that takes aligned reads, produces pileup image tensors from them, classifies each tensor using a convolutional neural network and finally reports the results in a standard VCF or gVCF file. Variant calls generated by DeepVariant are joint genotyped using [GLnexus](https://github.com/dnanexus-rnd/GLnexus), and then normalized using bcftools norm. Only the normalized vcfs are placed in the output folder by default.

> **NB**: In case you are running the separate mitochondrial analysis, mitochondrial calls are filtered from the normalized vcfs before they are published using GATK SelectVariants.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `call_snv/`
  - `<case_id>_split_rmdup.vcf.gz`: normalized vcf file containing MT variants. Only published when `--skip_mt_analysis` is set.
  - `<case_id>_split_rmdup.vcf.gz.tbi`: index of the normalized vcf file containing MT variants. Only published when `--skip_mt_analysis` is set.
  - `<case_id>_nomito.selectvariants.vcf.gz`: normalized vcf file containing no MT variants.
  - `<case_id>_nomito.selectvariants.vcf.gz.tbi`: index of the vcf file containing no MT variants.

</details>

#### Sentieon DNAscope

The pipeline performs variant calling using [Sentieon DNAscope](https://support.sentieon.com/manual/DNAscope_usage/dnascope/) with a machine learning model. This approach identifies the candidate sites with a higher accuracy, and calculates genotypes for each sample at that site. These files are treated as intermediates and are not placed in the output folder by default. DNAscope is not run by default. To use DNAscope instead of DeepVariant, set `--variant_caller` to sentieon.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `call_snv/`
  - `<case_id>_split_rmdup.vcf.gz`: normalized vcf file containing MT variants. Only published when `--skip_mt_analysis` is set.

  - `<case_id>_nomito.selectvariants.vcf.gz.tbi`: index of the vcf file containing no MT variants.

</details>

### Variant calling - SV

#### Manta

[Manta](https://github.com/Illumina/manta) calls structural variants (SVs) and indels from mapped paired-end sequencing reads. It combines paired and split-read evidence during SV discovery and scoring to improve accuracy, but does not require split-reads or successful breakpoint assemblies to report a variant in cases where there is strong evidence otherwise. Output vcf files are treated as intermediates and are not placed in the output folder by default.

#### TIDDIT sv

[TIDDIT's sv](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/TIDDIT) is used to identify chromosomal rearrangements using sequencing data. TIDDIT identifies intra and inter-chromosomal translocations, deletions, tandem-duplications and inversions, using supplementary alignments as well as discordant pairs. TIDDIT searches for discordant reads and split reads (supplementary alignments). Output vcf files are treated as intermediates and are not placed in the output folder by default.

#### SVDB merge

[SVDB merge](https://github.com/J35P312/SVDB#merge) is used to merge the variant calls from both Manta and TIDDIT. Output files are published in the output folder.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `call_sv/`
  - `<case_id>_sv_merge.vcf.gz`: file containing the merged variant calls.
  - `<case_id>_sv_merge.vcf.gz.tbi`: index of the file containing the merged variant calls.

[bcftools roh](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html#roh) is a program for detecting runs of homo/autozygosity.from only bi-allelic sites. The output files are not published in the output folder by default, and is passed to vcfanno for further annotation.

#### vcfanno

[vcfanno](https://github.com/brentp/vcfanno) allows you to quickly annotate your VCF with any number of INFO fields from any number of VCFs. It uses a simple conf file to allow the user to specify the source annotation files and fields and how they will be added to the info of the query VCF. Values are pulled by name from the INFO field with special-cases of ID and FILTER to pull from those VCF columns. The output files are not published in the output folder by default, and is passed to vep for further annotation.

#### VEP

[VEP](https://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html) determines the effect of your variants on genes, transcripts, and protein sequence, as well as regulatory regions. We recommend annotating with the following plugins:

- LoFtool
- pLI
- SpliceAI
- MaxEntScan

Based on VEP annotations, custom scripts used by the pipeline further annotate each record with the most severe consequence, and pli scores.

### Mitochondrial analysis

Mitochondrial analysis is run by default, to turn it off set `--skip_mt_analysis` to true.

#### Alignment and variant calling

[Alignment and variant calling - GATK Mitochondrial short variant discovery pipeline ](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/4403870837275-Mitochondrial-short-variant-discovery-SNVs-Indels-) The mitochondrial genome poses several challenges to the identification and understanding of somatic variants. The circularity of the mitochondrial genome means that the breakpoint in the reference genome is at an arbitrary position in the non-coding control region, creating a challenge in analyzing variation. Additionally, insertions of mitochondrial DNA into the nuclear genome (NuMTs) complicate the mapping of the mitochondrial genome and the distinction between NuMTs and the mitochondrial contig of interest. Lastly, mitochondrial variants often have very low heteroplasmy. Such low allele fraction (AF) variants can thus be mistaken for inherent sequencer noise.

The pipeline for mitochondrial variant discovery, using Mutect2, uses a high sensitivity to low AF and separate alignments using opposite genome breakpoints to allow for the tracing of lineages of rare mitochondrial variants.

#### Annotation:

##### HaploGrep2

[HaploGrep2](https://github.com/seppinho/haplogrep-cmd) allows detecting artificial recombinants and missing variants as well as annotating rare and phantom mutations in mitochondria. Haplogrep generates a text report, which is published by default.
